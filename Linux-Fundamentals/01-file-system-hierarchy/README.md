# 📂 Linux Filesystem Hierarchy

These are my notes on the standard Linux directory structure. It is important to know where files are stored!

| Path | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`/`** | **Root Directory.** The top-level directory containing all files required to boot the OS. All other filesystems are mounted under here. |
| **`/bin`** | Contains essential command **binaries** (programs) that are needed for the system to run. |
| **`/boot`** | Consists of the **bootloader**, kernel executable, and files required to boot the Linux OS. |
| **`/dev`** | Contains **device files** (like hard drives, webcam, mouse) to access hardware attached to the system. |
| **`/etc`** | Local **system configuration** files. Settings for installed applications are usually saved here. |
| **`/home`** | **User directories.** Each user has a folder here to store their personal files (e.g., `/home/student`). |
| **`/lib`** | Shared **library files** that are required for the system and binaries to boot/run. |
| **`/media`** | Mount point for **removable media** like USB drives or CD-ROMs. |
| **`/mnt`** | Temporary **mount point** for filesystems (often used by admins manually). |
| **`/opt`** | **Optional** add-on software packages (third-party applications) are installed here. |
| **`/root`** | The home directory specifically for the **root user** (superuser). |
| **`/sbin`** | Contains **system binaries**. Similar to `/bin`, but these are used for system administration (maintenance). |
| **`/tmp`** | Stores **temporary files**. This directory is usually cleared when the computer restarts. |
| **`/usr`** | Contains user utilities and applications (Multi-user utilities). Stands for **Unix System Resources**. |
| **`/var`** | Contains **variable data** files that change often, like **log files**, emails, and website files. |
